[color=aqua]All open scripts[/color] will be shown by default.

[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show the open scenes.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show all scripts and scenes.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show all scripts.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show all scenes.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show the open scripts and scenes.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] followed by a number will jump to that line in the script editor when activating the filter or ending the search_string with a space.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list the methods of the current script with the line number. Activating the method will jump to that line in the script.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list all signals of the current scene root. Activating a signal will insert the signal connection at the cursor position with the cursor position moving to the signal target. The signal method will be copied to the clipboard.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show the code snippets. Activating a snippet will insert it at the cursor position. Custom snippets can be created by editing CodeSnippets.cfg. The sections are the names shown in the item_list. "body" is the only section key, which has to be defined. Adding an [color=aqua]%s[/color] into the snippet will make the cursor jump to that position when inserting the snippet. By default a few virtual methods are implemented.

[color=aqua]Ending[/color] the search_string with [color=aqua]  X[/color] (but before the " e" for snippets), where X is an integer, will jump to the X-th item in the list.

Opening a script will switch to the scene tab the script is attached to. It only works, if the script is attached to the scene root. This will give you autocompletion on Node(Path)s and their methods.

Selecting the file path will jump to the file in the filesystem dock.

While the popup is visible, pressing the shortcut again will switch to the last file opened with this plugin. The two labels at the bottom show the current and the last file opened with this plugin. Scene files (.tscn) should have the same name as the scene root (which is the default setting in Godot).

Pressing the copy button while a file name is selected, will copy the path to the file to the clipboard. If a code snippet is selected, the snippet will be copied to the clipboard.

Some export vars are available. Reopen the project after changing those or other things in the inspector of this plugin.
